:star: Based on **OpenCV**

:floppy_disk: [`set_color_range.py`](set_color_range.py) allows to set the color range required to detect the object to be tracked

:pencil2: [`paint.py`](paint.py) tracks the object its color was set and enables the painting

## Features

- [x] 3 different marker thicknesses (small, medium, large)

- [x] 5 different colors (ðŸŸ£purple, ðŸ”µblue, ðŸŸ¢green, ðŸ”´red, ðŸŸ¡yellow)

- [x] paints can be erased and the entire page can be cleaned

- [x] possible to write discrete (with a little trick)

### :rocket: Set Color Range
:white_check_mark: _Color range can be adjusted with trackbars_

:white_check_mark: _After determining the color range, save by pressing the 'S' key, it will save a numpy array as `hsvVal.npy`_

:white_check_mark: _Press 'Q' to exit_

## How to use?
:one: Run the `set_color_range.py` file to set the color range (just make sure the object is detected)

:two: Save the adjusted values by pressing the 'S' key, values will be saved as `hsvVal.npy` file

:three: Run the `paint.py` file, it will automatically open the `hsvVal.npy` file

:100: Enjoy painting!
